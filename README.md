# Flood
Projects here are eventually live at https://takenattheflood.us

## Contents
This repository is a liason between my [online portfolio](https://littlefurnace.com) and my local wordpress 
development.  Locally I work on Wordpress on my Mac Powerbook using the Vagrant 
box Varying Vagrant Vagrants virtual Linux environment and then selectively copy parts of it to this repository.  .

## Why *Taken At The Flood*?
This is from Act V of Julius Caesar.  Brutus explains his resolve, that 
he has no regret for joining the junta.  He goes to his death as a real Roman, 
unconflicted.
A 1947 book title by Agatha Christie beat me to "Taken At the Flood".

## About this page
Two of my oldest friends died in 2017 and the year after that, my dad went.  Some of the content here provides a permanent URL for their memorials.  
This was first deployed on October 10th, 2018, at One+One Hosting.  In early 2019 I moved it to my own computer at Digital Ocean.  <br/>

## Old page from 2018

I did this tribute page when I was learning CSS.  Now I am getting ready to convert it into Wordpress files and deploy 
them live.
