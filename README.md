# What is this
A static web page.
Managed by ssh and git pulls at 1&1 hosting.
It is my current pedagogical project. 
I have found it very motivational.

## To Do
* make both containers the same per TBS, viz width, corners
* lower-res the whitney panorama
* bring the font blue closer to the sky blue in the photo
* refactor static html to Elm
* add Elm model-update-view for one feature
* learn the logs: which does which, how to download server logs to local for archiving and inspection
* rudimentary SEO
* Install node on their server
* build the API
* Twillio

## Why *Taken At The Flood*?
This is from Act V of Julius Caesar.  Brutus explains his resolve, that 
he has no regret for joining the junta and goes to his death as a real Roman, 
unconflicted.
A 1947 book title by Agatha Christie beat me to this quote.

## How's it going so far?
__I'm doing it the hard way:__
Instead of ftp, I am updating my web page via LocalCommit -> GitHubRemote -> PullToHostingServer.  This is 3x more steps and is causing many merge/conflicts.<br>
__Good news:__ I'm getting much better at Git and Vim-mergetool. And it's a good place to be wrong: this is a  low-stakes, static, mostly-for-fun page. 
This was first deployed on October 10th, 2018, at http://takenattheflood.us<br/>
It is my first command-line-deployment to a shared server (1&1).
