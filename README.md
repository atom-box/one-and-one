# one-and-one (named for its host, the 1&1 server).
A static web page.

## About
This was first deployed on October 10th, 2018, at http://takenattheflood.us<br/>
It is my first command-line-deployment to a shared server (1&1).

## To Do
* make both containers the same per TBS, viz width, corners
* lower-res the whitney panorama
* bring the font blue closer to the sky blue in the photo
* Install node on their server

## Why *Taken At The Flood*?
This is from Act V of Julius Caesar.  Brutus explains his resolve, that 
he has no regret for joining the junta and goes to his death as a real Roman, 
unconflicted..
A 1947 book title by Agatha Christie beat me to this quote.
