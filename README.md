# What is this
A static web page.
Managed by ssh and git pulls at 1&1 hosting.
It is my current pedagogical project. 
I have found it very motivational.
This was first deployed on October 10th, 2018, at http://takenattheflood.us<br/>
It is my first command-line-deployment to a shared server (1&1).

## To Do
* add modest SEO to get Dad's obituary visible
* add Elm model-update-view for one feature
* learn the logs: which does which, how to download server logs to local for archiving and inspection
* Install node on their server
* build the API
* Twillio

## Why *Taken At The Flood*?
This is from Act V of Julius Caesar.  Brutus explains his resolve, that 
he has no regret for joining the junta.  He goes to his death as a real Roman, 
unconflicted.
A 1947 book title by Agatha Christie beat me to this quote.

## How's it going so far?

__October 12, 2018__
It's up!  No CMS, just an index.html file, live.  
__October 14, 2018:__
Instead of ftp, I am updating my web page via LocalCommit -> GitHubRemote -> PullToHostingServer.  This is 
3x more steps and causes many merge/conflicts. Which are interesting, Git-pedagogically. Git says 
"here, try your first taste of Vim-Merge".<br>

__October 22, 2018__
Workflow more conventional now: edit my .Elm file.  Compile that in Elm compiler to html/js.  Push those 
directly by mirroring to the hosted server at 1&1 with FTP or sometimes Beyond Compare mirror.
