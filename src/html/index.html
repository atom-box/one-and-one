  					<p>We have tried the utmost of our friends, Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe. The enemy increaseth every day. We, at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, <a id="board-onionskin__link" href="https://www.sparknotes.com/nofear/shakespeare/juliuscaesar/page_186/">taken at the flood</a>, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures.</p>
