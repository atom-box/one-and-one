Cam Soper
Harmony

You know the feeling. An executive sends that email that your web application's performance is costing sales. All hands on deck! Fix it now! Your future is now hours poring over log files, days guessing where the bottleneck is. You hope for success with each new deployment. There's a different path. Application Insights to the rescue!  Instrument your app with Application Insights to get a deep look into the performance profile of your on-premise or Azure-hosted app. Prevent bottlenecks before you get that "all hands on deck" email.

You will learn:

    What telemetry Application Insights collects automatically
    How to instrument your ASP.NET Core application with custom events and metrics
    How to view and analyze the telemetry using Azure's powerful tools

A Tale of Two Teams
agile
leadership
teams
Dana Jones
Inspire

Our team is made up of a real mixed bag of developers and product managers.

    Our company is based in New York, but most engineers work remotely.
    We have developers on staff that have a range of experience levels.
    Our team includes people in four time zones and two continents.
    Teams include an assortment of staff engineers and contractors.
    We run the gamut from chatty and extroverted to quiet and introverted.
    The nature of the work on each team is very different -- from a long-overdue Rails upgrade, to incorporating internationalization, to addressing bugs and adding features.

One size does not fit all! It became quickly apparent to us that we needed to adapt our meetings to our people. Everything from scheduling, structure, leadership, and goals for each meeting needed to be carefully considered to add cohesion and remove distraction.

This talk will:

    distill what we learned along the way,
    share tips for recognizing meetings that have lost their purpose,
    offer suggestions for different types of retrospectives to fit different teams,
    propose a checklist for sprint kickoffs, and hopefully
    ignite more conversation around adapting processes to people instead of the other way around.

Our team works primarily in Ruby on Rails, but the information I want to share applies to any development team, working in any tech stack.
The Internet of JavaScripty Things: Control Hardware with Web Bluetooth

Matt Steele
Serenity

After a late-night eBay bender, you've acquired a cornucopia of Bluetooth-enabled gizmos: heart rate monitors, BBQ thermometers, light bulbs. As you stare at them your mind races: now what? In this talk we'll check out the Web Bluetooth API, a new way to control physical devices from your browser. We'll see how to build webapps that react to Bluetooth inputs, how to reverse engineer strange ArrayBuffer streams, and how to power your conference slide deck with a bicycle. Eesh, I hope that last demo doesn't fail.
Mastering Your Work

Matthew Schladweiler
Clarity

We have all met superstar Software Engineers and Developers. They work just over 40 hours a week, but get nearly twice as many PBI's done as everyone else, seemingly always have a solution to every problem, and have such high code quality that it's almost impossible to find a fault in their logic. Yet, when we try to follow in their footsteps, we end up with 60 hour work weeks, hair loss and broken keyboards. What do they do that is different from everyone else?

We'll take a look at how these superstars work. We'll dive into their mindsets and see how they optimize for learning, prioritize tasks, do less and obsess in ways that make them have passion and purpose to allow them to not only excel, but have less stress and be happier in a field that is overburdened by burnout, impostor syndrome, and bad work-life balance.
The Web is For Everyone: Getting Started with Accessibility
accessibility
users
William Springer
Prosperity

It is now a given - or at least, it should be - that our work should be accessible to as wide an audience as possible. Too often, though, this isn't the case; either because developers don't know how to make our work accessible or because we don't know how to make a business case for investing time in accessibility.

A large percentage of the population will have a disability at some point in their lives. For some, this will be a permanent disability, such as someone losing his sight. For others, it will be temporary, such as someone unable to make finely controlled mouse movements due to an injured wrist. It may even be very temporary - the person who can't read an important document because it doesn't display correctly on her smartphone. By following best practices for accessibility, we can allow people who would otherwise be locked out of our websites to use them effectively, while also improving usability for the majority of the audience who do not actually identify as disabled.

This talk covers both general design principles to follow and some specific technical changes to make when coding.
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes: Taking Your MongoDB Stitch Application to the Next Level With Triggers
serverless
Blake Schoppa
Progress

MongoDB Stitch is a serverless platform designed to help you easily and securely build an application on top of MongoDB Atlas. It lets developers focus on building applications rather than on managing data manipulation code, service integration, or backend infrastructure. MongoDB Stitch also makes it simple to respond to backend changes immediately, allowing you to simplify client side code and build complex flows more easily. This talk will cover ways that MongoDB Stitch helps you respond to changes in your database and take your applications to the next level.

Ashley Dzick
Inspire

According to Human Factors International, “an estimated 50% of dev rework could have been avoided with usability testing.” Usability testing is an inexpensive, quick and iterative way to get meaningful feedback around product decisions before they make it to the coding stage. It’s easy enough to execute that anyone can do it. We'll walk through a very quick introduction, how to test (even on a budget of $0), and run through some successful case studies.

    Attend this talk if you:
    Are looking to gather meaningful feedback
    Develop front-end facing applications
    Work alongside a UX team
    Are just interested in learning more

The Microservice Manifesto
architecture
microservices
Chase Aucoin
Serenity

Microservices have been a hot-button topic for a few years, but what are they, why would I need them, and how will they help me? The Microservice Manifesto sets out to put forward an opinionated but dogma-free approach to bringing Microservices into your organization regardless of language or technology stack that will help you get products delivered faster, more securely, and error free.

I've helped fortune 50-500 companies in the US and large organizations all over the globe tackle some of the worlds hardest challenges and get the most out of their software development life-cycle using Microservices. So you'll learn the do's and don'ts that will make you more successful with your Microservice implementations.
What's New In C#

David Pine
Prosperity

The C# language team has been making some awesome improvements. In March 2017, we were given C# 7. This major release brought some powerful features such as: pattern-matching, tuple literals/deconstruction, and local functions to name a few. Since then the team introduced the notion of point releases. Expect to learn about all the features of C# 7, as well as the C# 7.1 and 7.2 point releases. Additionally, we'll take a look at the plan for C# 8.

Git it Done: Effective Feature Development
source control
teams
Kyle Welch
Harmony

Source control can easily be seen as only a caretaker for history and has so much more power that can be leveraged to increase productivity.

Throughout this session we will cover basics of git such as branches, commits, and remotes. Building from this base knowledge we will explore real world patterns that have helped teams be more productive. The journey will continue with us exploring how to extend git using tools like GitHub and TravisCI that can be used to create reviews, validate commits, and foster collaboration.

You will leave with a solid knowledge of git and the understanding of ways to integrate it into your flow.
Modeling Beauty - How to Teach Machines to Recognize and Classify Aesthetics
ai
machine learning
Rachael Ferguson
Clarity

Machine learning may be a hot topic in the tech industry currently, but what exactly does it represent and what can it be used for? This talk will explain ML in an approachable, easy to grasp way applied to an interesting concept. Can we determine abstract concepts like beauty using machine learning? What is the appeal of being able to do so? Does it make a machine more human? Or does it expose the human experience as a list of 1s and 0s?

This talk explores these questions and concerns in regards to applying machine learning to classically artistic pursuits. Participants will first be exposed to an overview of the breadth of human-defined beauty. Then, they will be able to examine a convolutional neural network model, pre-trained on labelled images, defined using Python and TensorFlow, and judge its ability to determine aesthetic merit for input images.

The goal of this talk is to encourage clamor, creativity, and care surrounding machine learning.
Session 4 - 2:00 - 2:50
Entity Framework Core in the Real World
.net
database
Adam Kerr
Harmony

EF Core makes it easy to quickly stand up a data store for your application. As the application grows in complexity, though, it's important that the data store also evolves. This session goes beyond setting up basic tables, and moves into the depths of EF Core. We'll cover real-world lessons and their applications, like:

    Using scoping to control memory usage
    Dependency injection best practices - do it the way Microsoft does!
    Using change tracking (or not using it) for auditing and performance
    Using inheritance and reflection to generate a consistent schema
    Thinking about how LINQ queries are translated to SQL
    Cool tricks like Global Filters

The Saboteur in Your Retrospectives: How Your Brain Works Against You
agile
personal growth
teams
Arthur Doler
Serenity

You’ve bought into the Agile process. Your team is grooming its backlog, keeping its work-in-progress low, and focusing on delivering value to the users. But when you all sit down for a retrospective, there’s something working against you - your own brains. Using unconscious shortcuts and hidden heuristics, they can lead your team down a path to the worst result possible: wasting time!

You don’t have to take that lying down - you can fight back! Come learn about how your brain interprets cause and effect, the ways in which it wants to think of things as narratives, and all the tricks it does to save itself from having to think. You’ll learn how to maximize your time as we cover ways to focus your retros on what matters, talk about how to avoid getting trapped in the blame game, and discuss the value of perspectives.
