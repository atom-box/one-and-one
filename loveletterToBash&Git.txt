I can't imagine preferring a GUI over the command line.
When people say Americans have no sense of history my mind goes to developers 
who stay in a GUI.
I can't imagine not having my workflow in the command line.
Love letter to BASH & Git
Your detailed searchable history of years worth of all my verbs..  
Add to that Version Control (e.g. Git) preserving your nouns and your whole 
project, your whole career, becomes a Whovian landscape, the terminal 
acting as your Tardis.
I need a command line for my life.
