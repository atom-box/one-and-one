    <h2>1965-2016</h2>
    <p>Carl Zemke passed away Tuesday, October 11, 2016 in his home.  Carl attended Andover Lahser High School, Oakland University.  He loved Soccer, skiing, glass blowing, and his little red pickup truck.  I knew Carl in the 1980s and 1990s.  At university we got into shenanigans together, including liberties in the employees-only areas at Blue Mountain Ontario, taking a 30 minute cab ride in Toronto that we had no money to pay for, borrowing the campus security vehicle and  abandoning it behind the school gym, and a night in Detroit jail for writing our friend's name on a wall near the Wayne State athletic field.  Our more respectable activities were studying for undergrad tests in engineering and riding bikes in Chicago where he came to visit me a few times after college.  We loved professor Robert Feinstein's Organic Chemistry class at Oakland University.  Carl liked to walk barefoot in the city: think of the most littered, broken glass place -- Carl would take off his shoes to stroll there.  I've never had a friend that enjoyed living as much as Carl did.</p>

    <h2>1932-2018</h2>
    <p>My father, Kenneth Paul Genest was the son of Mildred Genest & Arthur Genest, and husband of Sharon Genest. <a href"https://wujekcalcaterra.tributes.com/obituary/guestbook/Kenneth-Paul-Genest-106247969">Ken Genest obituary, full</a>  My dad was born March 3, 1932.  He died July 8, 2018.  He had been declining for two years due to ALS when a fall at a restaurant left him bleeding from the head and led to hospitalization.  He was too weak after that to breathe under his own power.  It was decided to take out the breathing tube.  He passed away surrounded by a dozen loving family members around his hospital bed.  In his long life he lived in Manchester, New Hampshire, Meriden Connecticut, overseas in Germany during military service, and finally in Clinton Township, Michigan. In the 1960s at General Motors Tech Center Design Staff his team designed the Chevrolet Corvair & Buick Riviera.  He graduated from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn New York where he met my mom, Lyn Sieffert (Jacky Grineff).  John Deere tractors and Volkswagen Beetles were high on his list of beautiful things. </p>

    <h2>1965-2017</h2>
    <p>Robert Miller was my roomate in college. I have not yet found Rob Miller's obituary . Rob lived in Auburn Heights, was born in Pontiac, Michigan, had two marriages and one son, Evan Miller.  Rob graduated Avondale High School and Oakland University.  Rob loved Prince, Michael, Detroit Tigers, and Shakespeare.  Rob lived in his imagination: Don Quixote, the Jay Gatsby, and Falstaff were real people to him.  Morris Day and later Miles Davis were his great heroes.  I would summarize Rob as passionate to the point of irrationality, which is the defintion of a Romantic, maybe. We met The Beastie Boys when they and we were 20 years old after their first show at St Andrews Hall in 1985.  They were here with almost no repertoire yet, had just a single, and were here for a one-off show on the quirk of 102.7 putting Cookie Puss in heavy rotation.  Rob and I drove to Toronto on an impulse one night, only to arrive having lost our money and immediately driving directly back home to Michigan.  He and I corresponded by text a lot during the Prince Fielder / Justin Verlander era of Detroit Tigers, thrilled that Miguel Cabrera won the Triple Crown that year.  Rob's family were extremely important to him.  His parents were gigantic heroes to him.  His grandmother was his spirtual center.  Rob's one ambition I remember is he wanted to write a great novel.  His role models in this may have been Charles Bukowski and David Foster Wallace.</p>
